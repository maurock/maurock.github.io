<img id="img-profile" src="../img/jumping_me.png" alt="A picture of me jumping in front of a lighthouse">

I am a PhD student in **Machine Learning** at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/) (UK). My research interests lie at the intersection of **3D Deep Learning, Neural Fields,** and **Robotics Perception** (Computer Vision, Tactile Sensing). I have a soft spot for **Computer Graphics** and **Physically-Based Rendering**. Previously, I worked as a Machine Learning research engineer in autonomous driving at the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), where I developed **Deep Reinforcement Learning** applications for self-driving vehicles.

I read papers following Andrew Ng's invaluable tips on <a href="https://youtu.be/733m6qBH-jI">How to read research papers (Andrew NG)</a>
