Hi there! I am doing a PhD in **Machine Learning** at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/) (UK). My research interests lie at the intersection of **3D Deep Learning, Neural Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting,** and **Robotics Perception** (Computer Vision, Tactile Sensing). I have a soft spot for **Computer Graphics** and **Physically-Based Rendering**. I am supervised by [Prof Nathan Lepora](https://lepora.com/) and [Dr Laurence Aitchison](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~laurence/), and I am fortunate to collaborate with and get guidance from [Alessio Tonioni](https://alessiotonioni.github.io/) (Google) and [Jonathan Tremblay](https://research.nvidia.com/person/jonathan-tremblay) (NVIDIA). Previously, I worked as a Machine Learning research engineer in autonomous driving at the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), where I worked and led EU-funded projects on autonomous driving, and developed **Deep Reinforcement Learning** applications for self-driving vehicles.

I read papers following Andrew Ng's invaluable tips on <a href="https://youtu.be/733m6qBH-jI">How to read research papers (Andrew NG)</a>
