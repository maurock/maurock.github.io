Think about an image of a squirrel floating in space, like the one in the video above. How can a computer understand what the image represents? What if we could teach a machine to *read* an image more like how we read text, by looking at meaningful chunks and understanding their relationships? **Introducing Vision Transformers**. Transformers power all the latest advances in AI, from Gemini to ChatGPT, Claude, LLaMa, and pretty much every big model you've heard of in the last two years. They are known to be ground-breaking language models, but they are also extremely powerful at solving computer vision tasks.

In this post, we'll understand what a Vision Transformer is and how it works in detail. We'll build and train a Vision Transformer from scratch to classify images. I'll focus on intuition, explaining the *why* behind each component, and walk through the code step-by-step.
I have included some <span style='background-color: #ffdfba91'>quizzes</span> and <span style='background-color: #c3b1e16b;'>recaps </span> along the way to reinforce understanding - spaced repetition! 🙌 
[The code for this blog post is here]()

We'll build and train using **Google's JAX** and the new [NNX](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/v0.8.3/experimental/nnx/index.html) library. NNX makes building complex models like ViTs more explicit and Pythonic. **Why JAX/NNX**? JAX is extremely efficient thanks to `jit` (just-in-time) compilation and fast automatic differentiation (`grad`). It also runs seamlessly on CPU/GPU/TPU. This great post covers its benefits: [PyTorch is Dead. Long Live Jax](https://neel04.github.io/my-website/blog/pytorch_rant/) (*Disclaimer*: I wouldn't say PyTorch is dead, I love Pytorch. But JAX is equally cool!).NNX is the new deep learning framework for JAX, which is currently [Google's recommended framework](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/why.html) and provides a more familiar object-oriented programming model (like PyTorch) while retaining JAX's functional principles.

<h3><span style="color: rgb(215, 215, 215);">#</span> Seeing the World Through Transformers</h3>
Remember our squirrel image? How can a Transformer, designed for text sequences, process it? The core idea is simple:

- **Patchify**: We first divide the image into smaller, fixed-size patches.
- **Flatten & Embed**: Each patch is just a collection of raw pixel data. To make sense of it, we need to convert each patch into a meaningful vector, or *embedding*. We flatten each patch and linearly project it into an embedding vector using a *learnable* transformation.
- **Add Position Info**: A Transformer doesn't inherently know patch order. It processes all patches in parallel. We add positional embeddings to retain spatial information.
- **CLS Token**: We add a special classification token embedding at position 0 in the embedding sequence. This token will learn to aggregate global image information.
- **Attention Magic**: Each embedding "looks" at all the other embeddings and decides which ones are most important to understand its own context. This is done through multiple layers of self-attention.
- **Classify**: We use the output corresponding to the CLS token to predict the image's class.

This is a high-level overview of the Vision Transformer architecture.
Let's build each part.

<h4><span style="color: rgb(215, 215, 215);">##</span> Step 1: Patchifying the Image, From Pixels to Patches</h4>

</div>

First, we need to break the image down into patches. Think of this like cutting a photo into a grid of smaller squares.
Instead of processing pixel by pixel like a Convolutional Neural Network does, we treat chunks of the image as the fundamental units.
This mimicks what happens in a sentence, where the fundamental input units are individual words (technically, chunks of words or *tokens*).
Slicing the image into tiny patches allows the Transformer to later find relationships between different parts of the image.

We use the `einops` library for elegant tensor manipulation. `einops` is beautiful, but can be cryptic. Here's what we do below in the `patchify_image()` function:
- We want to rearrange the pattern from `(Batch, Height, Width, Channels)` to `(Batch, Num_Patches, Patch_Dimension`).
- `"... (h p1) (w p2) c -> ... (h w) (p1 p2 c)"`: 
    - `(h p1)`: The Height dimension is composed of `h` patches, each of height `p1` (patch_size).
    - `(w p2)`: The Width dimension is composed of `w` patches, each of width `p2` (patch_size).
    - `c`: The Channels dimension (in our case `c`=3 for an RGB image).
- `-> ... (h w)`: The output sequence length is `h * w` (total number of patches, `N`).
- `(p1 p2 c)`: Each element in the sequence is a flattened patch of size `p1 * p2 * c` (the patch dimension, D_patch).

<pre class="code-block-pastel"><code class="language-python">
    # From src/transformer.py
    import einops
    import jax.numpy as jnp
    import functools
    from flax import nnx
    import jaxtyping as jt
    
    Float = jt.Float
    Array = jt.Array
    
    @functools.partial(jax.jit, static_argnames=("patch_size",))
    def patchify_image(
        image: Float[Array, "B H W C"], patch_size: int
    ) -> Float[Array, "B N D_patch"]: # N = (H/patch_size)*(W/patch_size), D_patch = patch_size*patch_size*C
        # Rearranges image from (Batch, Height, Width, Channels)
        # to (Batch, Num_Patches, Patch_Height * Patch_Width * Channels)
        patches = einops.rearrange(
            image,
            "... (h p1) (w p2) c -> ... (h w) (p1 p2 c)", # h, w are counts of patches
            p1=patch_size, # p1 = patch height
            p2=patch_size, # p2 = patch width
        )
        return patches
    </code>
</pre>
This function takes a batch of images `(B, H, W, C)` and reshapes it into a batch of sequences of flattened patches `(B, NumPatches, PatchSize*PatchSize*C)`.

Assuming:
- input image is `(1, 224, 224, 3)` and `patch_size` is 16
- then `h = 224/16 = 14`, `w = 224/16 = 14`.
- Number of patches `N = h * w = 14 * 14 = 196`.
- Patch dimension `D_patch = p1 * p2 * c = 16 * 16 * 3 = 768`.
- The output shape would be `(1, 196, 768)`.

The decorator `@functools.partial(jax.jit, static_argnames=("patch_size",))` applied to the function makes sure that JAX compiles this function for massive speedups on GPUs/TPUs. The argument `static_argnames=("patch_size",)` tells the JAX compiler that `patch_size` is *static*: its value is known at compile time and won't change during execution for that compiled version. JAX needs this information because `patch_size` is a Python integer, not a JAX tensor, and its value affects the tensor shapes, which must be static for compilation.

<h4><span style="color: rgb(215, 215, 215);">##</span> Step 2: Patch Embedding</h4> 

Raw pixel patches aren't ideal for a Transformer.
Pixel colors are simply intensity values, telling us the contribution of the <span style="color:red">Red</span>, <span style="color:green">Green</span>, and <span style="color:blue">Blue</span> channels.
Pixels do not inherently encode semantic information, and they are very sensitive to noise and minor shifts in lighting.
We need to map these raw patches to more useful, richer representations. The goal is to train our model to extract features that are relevant for the task at hand (e.g. image classification).
In other words, we need to project raw pixel patches into a *learned embedding space*, similarly to how words are embedded into high dimensional vectors in Natural Language Processing.

We use a standard Linear layer (`nnx.Linear`), a simple matrix multiplication + bias, to transform each flattened patch (e.g., 768 dimensions if patch size is 16x16 and 3 channels) into a desired embedding dimension (`dim_emb`, often 768 or higher in larger models). This layer's weights are learned during training, allowing it to discover how to best extract useful features from the raw patches.
We define an `nnx.Module` for this.
NNX encourages organizing parameters and logic together within modules following an object-oriented style.
We define a `PatchEmbedding` class inheriting from `nnx.Module`. Notice that `nnx.Linear` requires `rngs` (random number generators). This is a key aspect of JAX/NNX: randomness (for weight initialization) must be explicitly handled via Random Number Generator keys (`jax.random.PRNGKey`) to ensures reproducibility.
`nnx.Rngs` is a helper to manage these keys.

<pre class="code-block-pastel"><code class="language-python">
# From src/transformer.py
class PatchEmbedding(nnx.Module):
    """Patch embedding module."""
    def __init__(self, patch_size: int, out_features: int, rngs: nnx.Rngs):
        self.patch_size = patch_size
        self.out_features = out_features 
        self.channels = 3 # Assuming RGB images
        # A linear layer to project flattened patches
        self.linear = nnx.Linear(
            in_features=self.patch_size**2 * self.channels, # e.g., 16*16*3 = 768
            out_features=self.out_features, # e.g. 768
            rngs=rngs # NNX requires explicit RNG handling
        )

    def __call__(self, inputs: Float[Array, "B H W C"]) -> Float[Array, "B N D_emb"]:
        # Patchify the image using the function from Step 1
        patches = patchify_image(inputs, self.patch_size) # (B, N, P*P*C)
        # Apply the learned linear projection
        projection = self.linear(patches) # (B, N, D_emb)
        return projection
    </code>
</pre> 
This module takes the raw image, patchifies it internally using our previous `patchify_image` function, and then passes the sequence of flattened patches through a `nnx.Linear` layer to get the final patch embeddings.  Each patch is now represented by a vector of `out_features` dimensions.

<h4><span style="color: rgb(215, 215, 215);">##</span> Step 3: Positional Embeddings</h4> 
Standard Transformers are *permutation-invariant*, which means they treat input elements as an unordered set, not a sequence. In other words, they process patches in parallel, without any information on *where* each patch came from in the original image. But for images, the location of a patch matters! Sky above a tree depicts a landscape, while sky below a tree might suggest a lake and its reflection. We need to give the model information about each patch's original location. Instead of simply feeding in the raw index of a patch (like patch #1, #2, etc.), we use **positional embeddings**. These are learned vectors, one for each possible patch position in the sequence. Think of them as encoding the "address" or "coordinates" of each patch into a vector, allowing the model to understand the image's structure. The vector has the same dimensionality of the patch embeddings, so they can be directly added together.

**Why don't we simply use the raw index?** While fixed positional encodings (like sine/cosine functions) are an option, using *learnable* embeddings (`nnx.Param`) gives the model maximum flexibility. The model can learn the optimal way to represent position for the specific task and dataset. These learned embeddings can capture more complex spatial relationships than fixed schemes: for example, patches that are close together might have more similar embeddings.

<pre class="code-block-pastel"><code class="language-python">
# From src/transformer.py
class PositionalEmbedding(nnx.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_features: int, out_features: int, rngs: nnx.Rngs):
        """Initialize the Positional Embedding module.
        
        Args:
            in_features: The input dimension, typically number of patches + 1 (for CLS token).

        """
        self.in_features = in_features # Sequence length (NumPatches + 1 for CLS)
        self.out_features = out_features # Embedding dimension (dim_emb)
        key = rngs.params() # Get a JAX PRNGKey for initialization

    def __call__(self) -> Float[Array, "1 M D_emb"]: # M = NumPatches + 1
        # Simply returns the learned embedding table
        return self.pos_embedding
    </code>
</pre> 

We create a learnable `nnx.Param` tensor called `pos_embedding`. Its shape is `(1, NumPatches + 1, EmbeddingDim)`. We initialize these embeddings with small random values (scaled by 0.02). The `+ 1` in `NumPatches + 1` is for the special `[CLS]` classification token, which we'll introduce next.

<h4><span style="color: rgb(215, 215, 215);">##</span> Step 4: The CLS Token</h4>

Inspired by [BERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)), ViTs add an extra learnable embedding to the sequence of patch embeddings, usually at the beginning (position 0). This is called the `[CLS]` (classification) token. 
Think of this token as a special "summary" embedding.
This token has no direct input from the image pixels; it starts as a learned placeholder. 
The idea is that through the self-attention mechanism (coming next in Step 5!), will interact with all the patch embeddings. As information flows through the Transformer layers, the CLS token acts like a 'sponge', aggregating global information from the entire sequence of patch embeddings.
At the end of the Transformer, we can just use the output embedding corresponding to this CLS token to make the final image classification decision. 
This simplifies the architecture by providing a single, aggregated vector representation of the image ready for the classification head, rather than, say, averaging all patch embeddings.

<pre class="code-block-pastel"><code class="language-python">
# From src/transformer.py
# Inside VisionTransformer.__init__
self.cls_embedding = nnx.Param(
    # A single learnable embedding vector of dimension dim_emb
    jax.random.normal(key=self.rngs.params(), shape=(1, self.dim_emb)) * 0.02
)

# Function to prepend the CLS token
def add_classification_token(
    cls_embedding: Float[Array, "1 D_emb"],
    embeddings: Float[Array, "B N D_emb"]
) -> Float[Array, "B M D_emb"]: # M = N + 1 (Sequence length becomes NumPatches + 1)
    # Repeat CLS token for each item in the batch
    cls_embedding_batch = jnp.tile(
        cls_embedding, (embeddings.shape[0], 1, 1) # Shape becomes (B, 1, D_emb)
    )
    # Concatenate CLS token at the beginning of the patch sequence (axis 1 is sequence dimension)
    return jnp.concatenate([cls_embedding_batch, embeddings], axis=1)
    </code>
</pre> 

In the `VisionTransformer` class we define `cls_embedding` as another learnable `nnx.Param`. The `add_classification_token()` function takes this single CLS token, expands it to match the batch size of the patch embeddings using `jnp.tile`, and then prepends it to the sequence of patch embeddings. The positional embeddings are then added to this combined sequence.

<div class="note">
    <strong>Recap so far:</strong><br>
        Image -> Patches (<code>patchify_image()</code>)<br> 
        Patches -> Patch Embeddings (<code>PatchEmbedding</code>)<br>
        Prepend CLS Token <code>add_classification_token()</code>, using a learnable <code>cls_embedding</code><br>
        Add Positional Info (<code>PositionalEmbedding</code>) using learnable <code>pos_embedding</code><br>
</div>

Now we have a sequence of embeddings ready for the Transformer Encoder! The shape of this sequence is `(Batch, NumPatches + 1, EmbeddingDim)`.

</div>
**Attention: this is the heart of the ViT**. Let's start with a strongbuild a strong intuition for the self-attention mechanism. Imagine each token in our sequence (patch embeddings + CLS token) wants to update itself by gathering information from other tokens. To do this, each token generates three vectors from its own embedding: a Query (`Q`) representing its current state and what it's looking for, a Key (`K`) representing what it can offer, and a Value (`V`) representing the actual content it wants to share. These Q, K, V vectors are typically derived by multiplying the token's embedding by three separate learnable weight matrices (`W_Q`, `W_K`, `W_V`).

<div class="note">
Attention as a conversation: patch embeddings talk to each other to understand their context. Q="What I need", K="What I have", V="What I'll share if you pay attention".
</div>

The attention procedures compares its Query with the Keys of all other tokens (including itself). High similarity (*dot product*) means high relevance. These similarities become **attention scores**, which are normalized via softmax. The Query token then takes a weighted sum of all tokens' Values, using these attention weights. It pays more attention to tokens relevant to its Query. 
in other words, this process allows each token (patch embedding or CLS token) to "look" at all other tokens in the sequence and decide which ones are most relevant to it. It calculates attention scores, determining how much "focus" to place on other tokens when updating its own representation. 

In practice, we usually don't use a single set of ``W_Q, W_K, W_V` matrices. We use multiple sets in parallel, and this is called **Multi-Head Self Attention**. Each head performs the attention mechanism independently with its own learned projection matrices. This allows the model to capture different types of relationships and focus on different aspects of the information (e.g. one head might focus on texture, another on shapes, another on long-range dependencies). The outputs of these heads are then concatenated and linearly projected back to the original embedding dimension.

The attention magic happens in the *Transformer Encoder*, which is typically a stack of identical Encoder Blocks. Each block processes the sequence of embeddings, allowing tokens to interact and exchange information.

Let's look at the code for these components:

**Layer Normalization (`LayerNorm`)**:
This normalizes the activations across the embedding dimension for each token independently. It helps stabilize training and improve generalization by ensuring that the inputs to subsequent layers are within a consistent range. Our `LayerNorm` is parameter-free. This is not common, but I read this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07013) showing that parameters in this layer might not be always beneficial for training. 
<pre class="code-block-pastel"><code class="language-python">
# From src/transformer.py
class LayerNorm(nnx.Module):
    """Layer normalization module."""
    def __call__(self, x: Float[Array, "B N D"]) -> Float[Array, "B N D"]:
        x_mean = jnp.mean(x, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
        x_std = jnp.std(x, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
        return (x - x_mean) / (x_std + 1e-6) # Add epsilon for numerical stability
    </code>
</pre>

**Multi-Head Attention (`MultiHeadAttention`)**:
This module implements the core attention logic. Before looking at the code, it's important to understand what the key steps are:
1.  Input `x` (shape `B, N, D_emb`) is linearly projected into `Q`, `K`, `V` (each of shape `B, N, D_qkv`).
2.  `Q, K, V` are reshaped and transposed by `split_attention_heads` to `(B, num_heads, N, D_head_qkv)`.
3.  Scaled dot-product attention scores are computed: `scores = (Q_h @ K_h^T) / sqrt(D_head_qkv)`. The scaling by `sqrt(D_head_qkv)` prevents very large values when `D_head_qkv` is large, which could push softmax into regions with tiny gradients.
4.  `softmax` is applied to scores to get attention weights.
5.  Weights are multiplied by `V_h` to get the output for each head.
6.  Outputs from all heads are concatenated and passed through a final linear layer (`self.out`).
7.  Dropout is applied for regularization.

Please note that the [code on GitHub](https://github.com/maurock/vitax) evolves and might have slightly different wording and fewer comments. In this blog post I'm optimizing for clarity, while the code on GitHub is a bit more concise. However the mechanism is exactly the same.

**Skip Connections** These are very important! They add the input of a sub-block (like MHSA or MLP) to its output, preventing the vanishing gradient problem in deep networks by allowing gradients to flow more easily during backpropagation. They also allow layers to learn residuals, i.e., only learn the change/delta from the input.

The full Vision Transformer will stack multiple `EncoderBlock` instances sequentially. Each block further refines the token embeddings by allowing them to exchange and integrate information from across the entire image.

<h4><span style="color: rgb(215, 215, 215);">##</span> Step 6: Classification Head</h4> 

After passing the sequence through all the Encoder Blocks, we need to get our final classification. It's time to shine for the CLS token we added in Step 3.

The output embedding corresponding to the first token (our CLS token) is assumed to have aggregated the necessary information from the entire image via the self-attention process. We take this single embedding vector (which has `dim_emb` dimensions) and pass it through a final `nnx.Linear` layer. This layer projects the CLS token's embedding into a vector of scores, one for each possible class in our classification task.

As for the attention mechanism, we first go through all the steps we are going to see in the code. The `VisionTransformer` class ties everything together:
1.  Initializes all necessary components: patch embedding, positional embedding, CLS token, encoder blocks, and the final linear classification head.
2.  The `__call__` method defines the forward pass:
    *   Input image `x` is normalized.
    *   Patches are created and embedded.
    *   CLS token is prepended.
    *   Positional embeddings are added. We also add dropout for regularization.
    *   The sequence goes through the stack of `EncoderBlock`s.
    *   The output embedding corresponding to the CLS token (`vision_embeddings[:, 0, :]`) is extracted.
    *   This CLS token representation is passed to the final `self.linear` layer to produce class logits.

Ok, and here's the code:

We select the output corresponding to the first token (index 0, `vision_embeddings[:, 0, :]`) and pass it to a final `nnx.Linear` layer (`self.final_head`) whose output size is the number of classes. This final linear layer maps the aggregated representation from the CLS token (`dim_emb`) to the number of output classes (`num_classes`), producing the raw prediction scores (logits) for each class.

<h3><span style="color: rgb(215, 215, 215);">#</span> Training the ViT</h3> 

We have the model architecture, now it's time to train it! We'll use the Hugging Face dataset [snacks](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Matthijs/snacks) as an example. This is something that you can try by following the instruction in the [GitHub's README file](https://github.com/maurock/vitax).

We train the network via supervised learning: we show the model many labeled images of snacks and the model makes a prediction for each image. We compare this prediction to the true label using a loss function (cross-entropy for classification). Then, an optimizer (like Adam) uses the gradient of this loss with respect to the model's learnable parameters to slightly adjust them in a direction that *reduces* the loss. 

The code used for training is in `src/train.py` and `src/dataset.py`.  Here are the main components of our training procedure:

- Dataset Handling (`src/dataset.py`): The code uses the datasets library to load and preprocess data. It defines a `HF_Dataset` class to manage loading data (from Hugging Face Hub or from disk) and applying transformations like resizing. We also convert the Hugging Face `Dataset` into a simple dataclass more suitable for JAX: we batch images and labels into JAX numpy arrays (`jnp.array`) for efficient processing. `make_jax_dataset()` essentially creates `my_types.MyData` which stacks all batches along a new leading dimension, making it suitable for `nnx.scan`. This is where JAX differs from PyTorch!

- Loss Function (`src/train.py`): We use cross-entropy loss to compare the model's output logits with the one-hot encoded true labels. 
<pre class="code-block-pastel"><code class="language-python">
# From src/train.py
def cross_entropy(
    prediction: Float[Array, "B NumClasses"], label: Int[Array, "B NumClasses"] # Label is one-hot
) -> Float[Array, "B"]: # Loss per sample
    log_probs = nnx.log_softmax(prediction, axis=-1) # Numerically stable log(softmax(logits))
    return -jnp.sum(label * log_probs, axis=-1) # Element-wise product and sum

def loss_fn(
    model: transformer.VisionTransformer, batch: dict[str, Array] # batch from make_jax_dataset
) -> Float[Array, ""]: # Scalar loss
    prediction_logits, _ = model(batch["image"]) # Get model's raw scores
    label_one_hot = jax.nn.one_hot(batch["label"], num_classes=model.num_classes)
    
    sample_losses = cross_entropy(prediction_logits, label_one_hot)
    mean_loss = jnp.mean(sample_losses) # Average loss over the batch
    return mean_loss
</code></pre>

- Training Step (`src/train.py`): First, let's look at the most inner training function: `train_step()`. This function performs one update of the model's parameters using a single batch of data. NNX provides `nnx.value_and_grad()`, the core of NNX/JAX differentiation. This creates a function that, when called, returns both the loss value and the gradients of the loss with respect to the model's `nnx.Param`s. `nnx.Optimizer` (`optax.adam`) uses the gradients calculated via backpropagation to iteratively adjust model parameters to minimize the loss. `optimizer.update(grads)` applies the computed gradients to update the model parameters. `nnx.jit` compiles the `train_step()` for significant speedup on GPUs/TPUs accelerators, as we saw earlier.
  
<pre class="code-block-pastel"><code class="language-python">
# From src/train.py
from typing import Tuple # Added for type hint

@nnx.jit
def train_step(
    model: transformer.VisionTransformer,
    optimizer: nnx.Optimizer,
    batch: dict[str, Array], # A single batch, not MyData directly
) -> Tuple[transformer.VisionTransformer, nnx.Optimizer, Float[Array, ""]]: # Return model, optimizer, loss
    """Perform a single training step."""
    # NNX handles the state updates implicitly when methods like optimizer.update are called

    loss, grads = nnx.value_and_grad(loss_fn)(model, batch)
    optimizer.update(grads) # This updates the parameters within the model object tracked by optimizer

    return model, optimizer, loss # Return updated model, optimizer, and current loss
</code></pre>
- Training Loop (`src/train.py`): the `run_training()` function orchestrates the overall training. An `nnx.Optimizer` is created, wrapping the model and an Optax optimizer (e.g., `optax.adamw`). It iterates for a number of epochs. Inside each epoch, `nnx.scan` is used to iterate over all batches in `train_data` (which is of type `my_types.MyData`, where the first dimension is the number of batches). `nnx.scan` is a powerful JAX primitive for loops that carry state (here, the `model` and `optimizer` state). Validation can be performed periodically using `run_evaluation`.
<pre class="code-block-pastel"><code class="language-python">
# From src/train.py

from tqdm import tqdm # For progress bars

def run_training(
    config: my_types.ConfigFile,
    model: transformer.VisionTransformer,

    @nnx.scan
    def train_single_batch(
        carry: nnx.Carry, # Tuple of (model, optimizer)
        batch: my_types.MyData, # Input slice from train_data (a single batch)
    ) -> Tuple[nnx.Carry, Float[Array, ""]]: # Return updated carry and loss for this batch
        model, optimizer = carry
        model, optimizer, loss_value = train_step(model, optimizer, batch)
        return (model, optimizer), loss_value

    # Initialize the optimizer
    optimizer = nnx.Optimizer(model, optax.adamw(learning_rate=config["learning_rate"]))

    print("Starting training...")
    for epoch_idx in range(config["num_epochs"]):
        model.train() # Set model to training mode (e.g., enable dropout)
        
        # `train_single_batch_scan` is applied to each batch in `train_data`.
        # `train_data` provides the sequence of `batch` inputs.
        # `all_batch_losses` will be a JAX array of losses for each batch in the epoch.
        carry_after_epoch, all_batch_losses = train_single_batch_scan((model, optimizer), train_data)
        
        model, optimizer = carry_after_epoch # I'll write a new article soon on this line, more info below!
        mean_epoch_loss = jnp.mean(all_batch_losses)
        
        print(
            f"Epoch {epoch_idx + 1}/{config['num_epochs']}, Mean Training Loss: {mean_epoch_loss:.4f}"
        )

        if validation_data is not None:
            model.eval() # Set model to evaluation mode (e.g., disable dropout)
            # The run_evaluation function would also typically use nnx.scan
            mean_val_loss = run_evaluation(model, validation_data)
            print(f"Validation Loss: {mean_val_loss:.4f}")

    print("Training finished.")
    return model # Return the trained model
    </code>
</pre>

In summary, the `run_training()` function manages the entire training procedure: it initializes the nnx.Optimizer, loops through epochs and batches, calls the train_step, and logs the progress. `NNX` provides a more familiar, stateful object-oriented way to manage model parameters and state compared to pure functional Flax/JAX, making the code potentially easier to follow for those used to PyTorch/Keras, while retaining JAX's power. It requires explicit handling of random number generators (rngs) and organizes parameters within modules (`nnx.Param`, `nnx.Linear`).

<div class="note">
If you have worked with JAX, you'll know that JAX is functional by nature: a function takes something and returns something. The design in NNX, which allows for stateful operations, might seem counterintuitive if we are expecting strict functional purity everywhere. The line `model, optimizer = carry_after_epoch` is actually not necessary, contrary to what you might expect, because `optimizer.update() which is iterated by nnx.scan() is changing the <it>state</it> of the model. This is out of scope for this blog post, but I think this is interesting and I'll expand on it in a future post.

<h4><span style="color: rgb(215, 215, 215);">#</span> Conclusion</h4> 

⭐ We made it! We've walked through the entire process of building and understanding a Vision Transformer from scratch using JAX and the modern NNX library. 

<div class="note">
<strong>We've seen how to:</strong><br>
<ul>
<li>Transform images into sequences of patches.</li>
<li>Create learnable Patch Embeddings to represent these patches.</li>
<li>Incorporate positional information using learnable Positional Embeddings.</li>
<li>Utilize a special CLS token to aggregate global image features for classification.</li>
<li>Leverage Multi-Head Self-Attention within Transformer Encoder blocks to allow patches to interact and exchange information.</li>
<li>Construct the full ViT architecture by stacking these components.</li>
<li>Set up a JAX-idiomatic training loop using `nnx.jit`, `nnx.value_and_grad`, `nnx.Optimizer`, and `nnx.scan` to train the model effectively.</li>
</ul>
</div>

While the ViT we've built is a functional baseline, the field has evolved rapidly since the original paper in 2020. Many improvements and variations exist, such as different patchifying strategies (e.g., overlapping patches from Convolutional stems in Hybrid ViTs), more efficient attention mechanisms, alternative positional encoding schemes (e.g., 2D learnable, relative positional biases), and advanced training recipes.

However, the core concepts—patching, embedding, self-attention, and using a Transformer architecture for vision—remain fundamental. ViTs have not only achieved state-of-the-art results in image classification but also serve as powerful backbones for various other computer vision tasks like object detection, segmentation, and even in generative models like **Diffusion Transformers (DiTs)**. These could be exciting topics for future posts!

Please let me know if you have any feedback, corrections, or are interested in specific future topics. Hope this was useful, happy transforming!
